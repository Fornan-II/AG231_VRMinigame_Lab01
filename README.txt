The script file that contains the header is Manager.

The team includes Dana LeMay and Maxen McCoy.

The goal of our mini game was to create a game similar to racket ball. You would use a racket to hit a ball towards blocks on a wall, destroying them.
The more blocks you hit, the more points you get. However, if you miss the ball and it ends up behind you, the game ends.

Who did what:
Maxen:
-Set up level
-Oculus controller
-Brick scripting
-Paddle scripting
-Some ball scripting
-Button functionality
-3D modeling
Dana:
-UI setup (Manager Canvas)
-Manager script
-Ball script
-Point script
-Raycast with linerenderer


For the controls, the grip triggers are to grab objects.
The B button is to create a raycast that points to the menu.
The A button is used to to pause/unpause the game.
Left joystick to move

Careful not to hit anyone or anything in real life!

The time limit on the game is 30 seconds.

At the end of the game a menu similar to the pause menu pops up. The menu says "Game Over" and has restart and quit buttons. Also the simulation.
